# Whole or Half Steer

We also offer whole and half steer sold prior to harvest.

- Whole: $3700
- Half: $1900

A $1000 deposit for purchasing a whole steer ($600 for 1/2 steer) is required at the time of purchase with the balance due before transport to the processor.

` `

### **Here is how it works at _the Cowpen:_**

- The customer pays the farmer.
- The price includes transportation from our farm to the processor.
- The customer contacts the processor to advise on the cuts they want.
- The customer pays all processor fees. Usually a kill fee ($35-80) & Cut/Wrap fee ($500-700) These fees vary according to the animals' hanging weight.
- The processor calls the customer for pick up.

This puts the average cost around $9 per pound of take-home beef. (Usually around 500 lbs for a 1,200 lb steer)
